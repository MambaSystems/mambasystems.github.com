<h1>Expertly Crafted Web Applications</h1>
<hr/>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
When you have an idea for a web application, either to start your 
business or to augment your existing small business, turning it into 
reality can be a daunting task. You need to choose a language/platform combination,
select a source control strategy, prioritize features, pick a hosting option, implement security,
create an abstract model of your business, avoid the pitfalls of misimplementing data store interaction,
mindfully plan the user experience, and do 
all of this with rigorous attention paid to quality and maintainability.
